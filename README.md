A Pokémon game for Android!

## Introduction

It's like a normal Pokemon game, but more casual and you don't have to walk around, kinda...

## Details

The idea is to walk around in real life in place of walking around in game.  Each step you take earns you "Action Points" which you use you do various things like fighting wild pokemon or going to heal at the Pokémon Center.

At first, the story and pokemon will be as similar to 1st generation games as possible; mechanics, algorithms, and stuff like that will follow the latest generation.

I intend to eventually expand to include pokemon from later generations and extra story lines as well.

## Credits

- All code was written by me
- Sprites were gotten from [Veekun](http://veekun.com/dex/downloads), [spriters-resource](http://www.spriters-resource.com), or ripped by myself from fire red
- Full pokemon database downloaded from http://veekun.com/static/pokedex/downloads/veekun-pokedex.sqlite.gz

###### Postscript

Code is a little messy and mostly undocumented, I will get around to cleaning things up eventually.
